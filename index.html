                <p> Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.</p>

                <p>I'm currenlty a student in the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp, a 24 week full-stack development
                    program. I am actively seeking employment as a web developer and am open to work in most any
                    inudstry in the Atlanta metro area. You can see some of my development projects <a href="../Updated-Portfolio/portfolio.html">here</a>.</p>

                <p>I'm originally from a small town of about 2,500 people in rural Nebraska. I went to school at the
                    University of Nebraska at Kearney (Go Lopes) where I graduated in 2009 with a double major in
                    psychology and sociology. In 2011 I completed my masterâ€™s degree and graduated with a M.S.Ed. in
                    Student Affairs.</p>

                <p>I moved to Platteville, Wisconsin for three years where I worked as a professional Residence Hall
                    Director. In this role I gained my first hands-on experience working with HTML when I helped
                    migrate our departmental website through changes to two different content management systems.</p>

                <p>In 2014 I moved to Atlanta and began working at Georgia State University as an Academic Counselor.
                    In the summer of 2018 I took a 6 week course at GSU to learn how to pull data reports from Oarcle
                    PL/SQL. </p>

                <p>In the fall of 2018 I enrolled in the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp, a 24 week full-stack development
                    program. To see what languages I've learned/become familiar with, click <a href="../Updated-Portfolio/languages.html">here</a></p>
