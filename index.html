                <p> Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
                <p>I'm incredibly excited about taking this course and learning more about web development and I hope
                    to use this space to show off the skills I gain as I progress through the next 24 weeks of classes.</p>
                <p>I'm originally from a small town of about 2,500 people in rural Nebraska. I went to school at the
                    University of Nebraska at Kearney (Go Lopes) where I graduated in 2009 with bachelor’s degrees in
                    psychology and sociology. In 2011 I completed my master’s degree and graduated with a M.S.Ed. in
                    Student Affairs.</p>
                <p>I lived in Platteville, Wisconsin for three years where I worked as a professional Residence Hall
                    Director. In this role I gained my first hand-on experience working with HTML when I helped revise
                    our departmental website through changes to two different content management systems.</p>
                <p>In 2014 I moved to Atlanta and began working at Georgia State University as an Academic Counselor.</p>
                <p>While I have enjoyed my work in higher education, I am looking forward to the challenges that lie
                    ahead as I take this BootCamp course and I look forward to changing careers in the future with my
                    new skills.</p>
